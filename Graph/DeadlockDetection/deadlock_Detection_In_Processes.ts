//If you are given a series of processes and depenendency of these processes with each other in the form
//of graph edges.

// And you are asked to find if there is any deadlock present whithin these processes.

// Then you have to create a directed graph and find cycle in the directed graph.

// If you find cycle in directed graph then there is a deadlock in processes.
