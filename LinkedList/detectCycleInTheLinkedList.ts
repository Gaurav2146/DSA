// Let A, B and C be three distances.

// C is the length of cycle.

// C = B + Some_Constant - (1)

// 2(A + YC + B) = A + XC + B

// A + C(2Y - X) + B = 0

// A + B = C(X - 2Y)

// A + B = CK - (2)

//Equating equaltion (1) and (2) by assuming value of K as 1.

// C = B + Some_Constant
// C = B + A

//we can clearly see that Some_Constant is equal to A.
//So, A + B = C // Proved
